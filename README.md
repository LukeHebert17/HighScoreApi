# HighScoreApi

## Purpose 

This API is intended to manage and access scores for a game that utilizes high scores. My original intent was to create a quick project to brush up on ASP.NET Web APIs, but the idea turned into something I could utilize locally as I work on Godot simple projects and tutorials. 

## To Build
*IN PROGRESS. . .*


## Road Map
### Phase 1
- Utilize In-Memory Database for the DB context
- Implement RestAPI calls
- Establist a base
- Basic tests

### Phase 2
- Add support for a local SQLite DB
  - Includes scripting for setting up the DB locally on the server to minimize work on the user's end
- Additional tests

### Phase 3+ 
*This is items that can be added down the line as I dig further into (and inevitably refactor) this project. This of it more of a "Desired Features" list for the time being.*

- Support for other scoring methods (times, total failures before a score, wins/loss tracking, ghost metadata ala mario kart's ghost racing feature, etc.)
  - This will be broken into other tasks as this project goes along
- User validation (not a priority right now as it'll be running locally for my projects)


README will be updated as this project progresses. . .

## Troubleshooting
*In progress but I'm sure some will pop up*
